## Quick Start

**NOTE**: The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the PuTTY docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=putty \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/putty:/config:rw \
    jlesage/putty
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/putty`: This is where the application stores its configuration, states, log and any files needing persistency.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the PuTTY GUI.
